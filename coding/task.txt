Suppose the following scenario:

A large company became the victim of a spam campaign, where everyone has received an email containing a link to a malicious executable.
Each email has a link to a different executable, however all executables from this campaign are from the same malware family and act similarly.

It is known that at least 3 employees clicked the link and ran the executable on their workstation.
On all Windows workstations there is a security software installed which monitors system activity while the employee is logged on, and saves the logs in JSON format.
Included is the activity log of the 3 workstations that were certainly compromized.
Now we need to know if there are other compromized workstations, based on the logged activity.

Your task is to write a standalone program in Python, which has an activity log file as input, and determines if an executable from this campaign was run or not.

The Python program must be "production level" quality: the code must be stable, and you need to make sure that the decision logic can be included in another Python program with minimal effort.
